Eighty9
=======

I wanted a quick hassle free way of spinning up a basic web page with JS and
SASS ready tp go. NPM, Yeoman and Gulp are handy tools to make this happen.

Set up
------

`npm install -g yo`

`npm install -g generator-eighty9`

`cd /new/website/folder`

`yo eighty9`

To compile your SASS just run

`gulp`


Eighty9 was a great year 😍
